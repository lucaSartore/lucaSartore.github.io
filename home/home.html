            <h1 class="title">Hi, I'm Luca Sartore!</h1>
            <p class="text"> I am a Computer Engineering student at the university of Trento (IT).
                I have a background in electronics and automation from high school.
                I like programming, especially low level stuff like Rust and c++,
                I enjoy robotics, and the creative process that takes place when you try to write
                algorithms that interact with real world objects. I also enjoy movies and videogames.

            <h1 class="title">My experience during the RoboCup:</h1>
            <p class="text"> In High school I participated in the robocup junior competition. <br>
                Me and my team only had a small fraction of the knowledge that was needed to develop the project.
                But we didn’t surrender… we put hundreds of hours into the project… I learned Python,
                3D modeling and 3D printing from scratch, and our team finally succeeded and won first place in the World Championship!<br>
                In this experience I learned how to understand a big problem,
                split it into smaller pieces, and came up with a solution… the basic steps of Engineering.

            <h1 class="title">My experience in Erasmus:</h1>
            <p class="text"> 
                In High school I participated in the Erasmus+ program.
                I and some other students went to Prague during the summer,
                and worked there for a while. I really enjoyed the experience as it
                gave me the opportunity to experience what is like living and working in a foreign country.

            <h1 class="title">My experiences at University:</h1>
            <p class="text"> 
                I am enjoying my years at university, and I had the opportunity to do some really cool stuff…<br><br>

                For an exam, I ended up as the Leader/Project Manager of a group made up of 70+ people.
                The most important things that I learned in this field are how to manage a tram properly,
                and how to deal with conflicts inside the team.<br><br>

                I’ve been “hired” by the university as a tutor for the Advanced Programming course.
                I enjoyed this experience, as it gave me the opportunity to enhance my communication skills.
